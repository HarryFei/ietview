- Refactor out options and user dialogs for use in both target_addedit and global_options.

- Add a dialog that asks if the user would like to restart iscsi-target (how to be platform independent? /etc/init.d/iscsi-target restart) when iSNSServer get added or modified

- Add support for ietadm 0.4.17 (can get user info from ietadm)

- Fixup Details display.  Maybe have expandable categories or something.

- Maybe just display/edit the options that are in the configuration file.  If the target is not in the configuration file, you can show all runtime option.  This might be confusing, however.

- Data validation

- After doing an add/edit option and the subsequent reload, re-hightlight the selected target and reload the text details (especially after a reload).  Select the new target after an add.  Expand category if necessary.

- All options can probably be updates (no adds)

- Fully support Lun configurations (e.g. nullio)

- Put in a warning that if a user has deselected active and saved, that all record of the target will be lost.

- Able to 'kill' or 'delete' client sessions.

- Right click context menu, including a forced reload.
