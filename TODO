- Hitting enter in text fields on some dialogs (e.g. deny addedit) should be equivalent to OK

- Double click of a target should open up edit dialog.

- Add support for ietadm 0.4.17 (can get user info from ietadm)

- Fixup Details display.  Maybe have expandable categories or something.

- Maybe just display/edit the options that are in the configuration file.  If the target is not in the configuration file, you can show all runtime option.  This might be confusing, however.

- Data validation

- After doing an add/edit option and the subsequent reload, re-hightlight the selected target and reload the text details (especially after a reload)

- When loading the add/edit dialog, be sure to set the first tab as active.  It goes back to the last used tab automatically.

- Fix up OutgoingUser...maybe be uname/pass for everything (currently, in iet_config, it's a tuple (uname, pass))

- All options can probably be updates (no adds)

- Lots of options 'stretches out' the add/edit dialog permanently.  Either prevent that from happening, or return to normal size each time.
