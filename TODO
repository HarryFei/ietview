- Hitting enter in text fields on some dialogs (e.g. deny addedit) should be equivalent to OK

- Double click of a target should open up edit dialog.

- Add support for ietadm 0.4.17 (can get user info from ietadm)

- Fixup Details display.  Maybe have expandable categories or something.

- Maybe just display/edit the options that are in the configuration file.  If the target is not in the configuration file, you can show all runtime option.  This might be confusing, however.
