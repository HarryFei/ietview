- Refactor out options and user dialogs for use in both target_addedit and global_options.

- Add a dialog that asks if the user would like to restart iscsi-target (how to be platform independent? /etc/init.d/iscsi-target restart) when iSNSServer get added or modified

- Add support for ietadm 0.4.17 (can get user info from ietadm)

- If 0.4.17 is installed, then show the provisioned incoming users.

- Fixup Details display.  Maybe have expandable categories or something.

- Maybe just display/edit the options that are in the configuration file.  If the target is not in the configuration file, you can show all runtime option.  This might be confusing, however.

- Data validation

- All options can probably be updates (no adds)

- Fully support Lun configurations (e.g. nullio)

- Put in a warning that if a user has deselected active and saved, that all record of the target will be lost.

- Right click context menu, including a forced reload.

- Should save window size for next time.  Also, save the position of the horizontal pane separator
