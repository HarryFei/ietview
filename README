IETView is a GUI that manages iSCSI Enterprise Target (IET) server software.
With it you can, among other things,  view and edit existing target volumes,
create new target volumes, and manage connected clients.

If you downloaded this without knowing anything about IET or iSCSI, first
check out the IET webpage (http://iscsitarget.sourceforge.net/) and
wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI) for more information.

Dependencies
------------

Before installation, note that you'll need the following installed:
1) iSCSI Enterprise Target
    Grab their latest release from their sourceforge site:
        http://iscsitarget.sourceforge.net/

    I've so far tested with 0.4.15, but it should be compatible with
    releases 0.4.16 and 0.4.17.

2) Python and PyGTK
    IETView is a program written in Python (http://www.python.org), and built
    upon PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org).   The versions tested against are:
        Python: 2.4.3
        PyGTK: 2.10

    The code should be compatible with versions later than this (excluding 
    Python 3).


Installation
------------

IETView is packaged with distutils (http://docs.python.org/distutils/), and
can be installed with the following command:

python setup.py install

Then, running IETView is a simple as:
ietview

If you want to run without installation, just run the following command in 
the same directory as this README.
./ietview

IETView will complain if it isn't run with root privledges.  That's because 
it wants to write to certain IET files to update configuration (see next 
section for more info).  To run as root, you can use either login as root, 
use 'su' to become root, or use 'sudo', for example:
sudo ietview

if you installed, or the following if you didn't:

sudo ./ietview


File Access
-----------

IETView needs root access to make changes to IET.  The following files will be
overwritten when any targets are added, edited, or deleted:
/etc/ietd.conf
/etc/initiators.allow
/etc/initiators.deny

Backups of these files will be made when the program is first run.

Also, IETView depends on the 'iscsiadm' program to be in your PATH.  It should
have been installed along with your iSCSI Enterprise Target software.


Features
--------

- view, edit, and delete existing iSCSI volumes
- create and delete iSCSI volumes
- view and disconnect iSCSI clients (initiators)
- manage global IET parameters (e.g., iSNS)
- manage access controls to targets
